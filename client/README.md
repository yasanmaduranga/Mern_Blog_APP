# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



1) what is vite ?

Vite is a fast build tool and development server that is commonly used with React.js to improve the development experience. It was created as an alternative to slower bundlers like Webpack.

Key Features of Vite in React.js:

1.	Faster Development – Uses ES module imports (ESM) for instant hot reloads.
2.	Hot Module Replacement (HMR) – Updates components instantly without a full page reload.
3.	Optimized Builds – Uses Rollup for efficient production builds.
4.	Lightning-Fast Startup – No need to pre-bundle dependencies.
5.	Out-of-the-Box Support – Works seamlessly with JSX, TypeScript, CSS Modules, TailwindCSS, etc.

How to Use Vite with React.js:

1.	Create a Vite + React project: 
sh
CopyEdit
npm create vite@latest my-app --template react

2.	Move into your project folder: 
sh
CopyEdit
cd my-app

3.	Install dependencies: 
sh
CopyEdit
npm install

4.	Start the development server: 
sh
CopyEdit
npm run dev

5.	Build for production: 
sh
CopyEdit
npm run build

Why Choose Vite Over Create React App (CRA)?

Feature	                Vite	    CRA
Startup Speed	        Instant	    Slow
HMR (Hot Reload)	    Fast	    Slower
Production Build	    Optimized	Heavier
Configuration	        Minimal	    More Complex


2) what is imagekit.io ?

ImageKit.io is a real-time image and media optimization service that helps developers deliver images faster and more efficiently. It provides automatic image optimization, real-time transformation, and a global CDN to enhance website performance.

📌 How to Use ImageKit.io in React

1️⃣ Install the SDK
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install imagekitio-react

2️⃣ Initialize ImageKit
javascript
Copy
Edit
import ImageKit from "imagekitio-react";

const imageKit = new ImageKit({
  publicKey: "your_public_api_key",
  urlEndpoint: "https://ik.imagekit.io/your_imagekit_id",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <img
      src={imageKit.url({
        path: "/sample.jpg",
        transformation: [{ height: 300, width: 300, quality: 80 }],
      })}
      alt="Optimized"
    />
  );
};

🚀 Why Use ImageKit.io?

✅ Faster Page Load Speeds – Optimized images improve website performance.
✅ Reduces Bandwidth Usage – Compression reduces file sizes.
✅ Easy Integration – Works with React, Vue, Angular, and backend services.
✅ Global CDN – Faster delivery worldwide.

If you're handling lots of images in a React project, ImageKit.io is a great solution for seamless image management and optimization! 🚀

4) properties of img in imagekit.io?

In ImageKit.io, the <IKImage> component (from the imagekitio-react package) is used to display optimized images in React.js. This component automatically applies optimizations and transformations.

🔥 Properties of <IKImage> Component
Here are the main props you can use:

Property	        Type	        Description
urlEndpoint	        string	        The base URL of your ImageKit account (e.g., "https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id")
path	            string	        The relative path of the image in ImageKit storage.
src	                string	        Full URL of an image (useful for external images).
alt	                string	        Alternative text for accessibility (same as HTML <img> tag).
loading	            `"lazy"	        "eager"`
width	            `number         string`
height	            `number	        string`
transformation	    Array<Object>	List of transformations (resize, crop, quality, etc.).
lqip	            Object	        Shows a blurred preview while the full image loads (better user experience).
onError	            function	    Callback for error handling.
onLoad	            function	    Callback for successful image load.

📌 Example Usage of <IKImage> in React

1️⃣ Basic Image without Transformations
javascript
Copy
Edit
import { IKImage } from "imagekitio-react";

<IKImage 
  urlEndpoint="https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id"
  path="/sample.jpg"
  alt="Optimized Image"
/>;

2️⃣ Apply Transformations (Resize & Optimize)
javascript
Copy
Edit
<IKImage 
  urlEndpoint="https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id"
  path="/sample.jpg"
  transformation={[{ width: 300, height: 300, quality: 80 }]}
  alt="Resized Image"
/>;

3️⃣ Lazy Loading & Error Handling
javascript
Copy
Edit
<IKImage 
  urlEndpoint="https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id"
  path="/sample.jpg"
  loading="lazy"
  onError={() => console.log("Image failed to load!")}
  onLoad={() => console.log("Image loaded successfully!")}
/>;

🚀 Why Use <IKImage>?
✅ Automatic optimization & CDN delivery
✅ Easy transformations using props
✅ Lazy loading for performance
✅ LQIP support for a smooth user experience

3) what about security of imagekit.io?


🔐 Security in ImageKit.io
ImageKit.io provides several security features to protect your images, videos, and media assets from unauthorized access, misuse, and excessive bandwidth usage.

🔥 Key Security Features

1️⃣ Signed URLs (Prevent Unauthorized Access)
Secure private images by generating signed URLs that expire after a set time.
Useful for paid content, confidential documents, or protected user uploads.
✅ Example: Generating a Signed URL in React

javascript
Copy
Edit
import ImageKit from "imagekitio-react";

const imageKit = new ImageKit({
  publicKey: "your_public_api_key",
  urlEndpoint: "https://ik.imagekit.io/your_id",
  authenticationEndpoint: "https://your-backend.com/auth", // Backend API to sign URLs
});

const signedImageURL = imageKit.url({
  path: "/private-image.jpg",
  signed: true,
  expireSeconds: 300, // URL expires in 5 minutes
});

console.log(signedImageURL);

2️⃣ Token-Based Authentication (For Secure Uploads)
When allowing users to upload images, authentication tokens ensure that only authorized users can upload files.
✅ Example: Secure File Upload Using Authentication Token

javascript
Copy
Edit
<IKUpload 
  authenticationEndpoint="https://your-backend.com/auth"
  onSuccess={(res) => console.log("Uploaded successfully", res)}
  onError={(err) => console.log("Upload failed", err)}
/>
The authenticationEndpoint should be a secure backend API that generates temporary tokens for each user.

3️⃣ Restrict Image Transformations
Prevent arbitrary transformations (e.g., resizing, cropping) by allowing only predefined transformations.
Avoids excessive API calls & bandwidth abuse.
✅ How to Restrict Transformations

Go to Dashboard → Security Settings → Enable URL Signature for Image Transformations.

4️⃣ Domain-Level Restrictions
Allow images to load only on specific domains to prevent hotlinking (others using your bandwidth without permission).
✅ How to Set It Up:

Go to Dashboard → Image Origin Settings → Allowed Domains.

5️⃣ Rate Limiting & API Security
Set up rate limits to prevent abuse.
Use server-side authentication for critical operations.
Store API keys securely and never expose them in frontend code.

🎯 Best Practices for Security
✔ Use signed URLs for private images.
✔ Enable domain restrictions to prevent hotlinking.
✔ Generate upload authentication tokens for secure uploads.
✔ Restrict transformations to avoid bandwidth abuse.
✔ Keep API keys secret (store them in .env or backend).
